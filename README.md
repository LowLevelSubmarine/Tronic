## Develop for Tronic
### Kotlin / Java
Our current aim is to slowly transition to Kotlin. Which means, that new packages (or submodules) should be written in Kotlin from the start. When changing stuff, sticking to Java is still totally ok though.

### Create release
Just add the next version as a tag, and our CI generates a new build.
Ask a Tronic admin for an update, and your code will be up and running 10 seconds later.

## Install to host
1.  Download the newest version
2.  Just start the built jar in build/libs
3.  Configure the bot by filling in your Discord Bot-Token and your Discord user id as a its host in the generated config.json
4.  Have fun & enjoy!
