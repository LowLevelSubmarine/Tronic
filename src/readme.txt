### INFO ###
This bot is being made by Florian Weichert & Jonas Becker. You can host it for your own use or invite the official Tronic to your guild/server.
Keep in mind that using the official Tronic will make you dependent from the ontime of our hosting services,
and unable to make use of the "bot-wide" commands.

### SETUP ###
To host Tronic yourself, you will need a token. Its like username and password combined, which the bot uses to login to the discord services.
You can create one (20.03.2019) in the developers tab of discordapp.com "https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/".
To create a token go to "New Application" -> "Create" -> "Bot" -> "Click to Reveal Token".
